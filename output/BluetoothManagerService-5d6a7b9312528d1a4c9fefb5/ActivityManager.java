/**
 * <p>
 * This class gives information about, and interacts
 * with, activities, services, and the containing
 * process.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A number of the methods in this class are for
 * debugging or informational purposes and they should
 * not be used to affect any runtime behavior of
 * your app. These methods are called out as such in
 * the method level documentation.
 * </p>
 *
 *<p>
 * Most application developers should not have the need to
 * use this class, most of whose methods are for specialized
 * use cases. However, a few methods are more broadly applicable.
 * For instance, {@link android.app.ActivityManager#isLowRamDevice() isLowRamDevice()}
 * enables your app to detect whether it is running on a low-memory device,
 * and behave accordingly.
 * {@link android.app.ActivityManager#clearApplicationUserData() clearApplicationUserData()}
 * is for apps with reset-data functionality.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In some special use cases, where an app interacts with
 * its Task stack, the app may use the
 * {@link android.app.ActivityManager.AppTask} and
 * {@link android.app.ActivityManager.RecentTaskInfo} inner
 * classes. However, in general, the methods in this class should
 * be used for testing and debugging purposes only.
 * </p>
